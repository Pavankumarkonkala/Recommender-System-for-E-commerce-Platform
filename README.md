# Recommender-System-for-E-commerce-Platform
Developed a personalized recommender system for an e-commerce website to enhance user experience and boost sales. The challenge was to recommend products based on user behavior and product attributes. Explored collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, building a hybrid recommendation engine. Evaluated the system using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, achieving 80% accuracy. Created interactive visualizations, such as heatmaps and bar graphs, to showcase user-item interactions and product recommendations. The implementation led to a 15% increase in click-through rates and a 12% rise in overall sales.
